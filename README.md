## Professional Experience

### About Me

I am a software engineer with a background in web development. I genuinely enjoy working with code and I am passionate about learning new technologies. I have spent my career in the web development industry and have worked with a wide variety of technologies and languages. As much as I could be considered a full stack engineer, I am primarily focused on back end development, which is preferable. I find solving difficult problems invigorating. I am a fast learner and I am always looking to improve my skills. I am a team player and a problem solver. I believe anyone who writes software, whether it be a small hobby project or a large enterprise application, should enjoy the puzzle that is development.

### Preferred Work Environment

I find working remote is the best fit for me. I *do* love working as a team. I just don't love "the office" vibe. I find being comfortable in my space to be the key to productivity. Flexible working hours are very important as my family comes first. Also, with the flexibility of working remotely, I find I actually work more than the standard 40 hours. I love getting lost in a project and finding the solution to a tricky problem. Writing innovative and creative code is a great way to keep me motivated.
